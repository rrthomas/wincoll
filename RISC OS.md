# WinColl for RISC OS

I wrote WinColl in Forth in 1989-90 with the proprietary RiscForth from BlueGrey software. In 2024 I resurrected it to work with the RISC OS version of my own [pForth](https://github.com/rrthomas/pforth/releases/tag/riscos) compiler.

The sound module `UserVoices` was generated using a program from [RISC User Volume 1 Issue 4](https://ia903207.us.archive.org/18/items/Risc_User_Volume_1_Issue_4_1988-03_BEEBUG_GB/). I no longer have the source code for my adaptation of the module, which uses different sound data from the examples given in the magazine; reconstructing it would certainly be possible, though! Get in touch if you’re interested. One motivation is that the module seems to have a bug where it cannot be finalised.


## Installation and use

* Download and unpack the
  [Zip](https://github.com/rrthomas/wincoll/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) of
  the WinColl Git repository.
* Launch `!WinColl` (for example, by double left-clicking it).

WinColl should run on RISC OS 3.5 to 3.7, and could probably be made to run
on RISC OS 2 without difficulty.

You can edit the levels on RISC OS with the BASIC program `LevelDes` that
lives in the `!WinColl` folder. (Shift+Left double-click to open the
folder).


## Classic version

For historical interest, the [original game](https://github.com/rrthomas/wincoll/tree/classic) is also available, with the minimal updates required to make it run on pForth.
